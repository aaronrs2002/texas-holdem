In an attempt to drum up business I have written "Texas holdem" and "Five card draw" for the public to play free online. There's no app to install. These games work on any device and are hosted for free on my gitHub account, so special thanks to them. Other games include Black Jack, Trivia, Craps and a Slot Machine web application.
